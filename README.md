# Linear Algebra Operations

Everyone has to like algebra, love algebra, live by and for algebra... But it can get really tricky sometimes.

So I tried to make it easier, I guess.

Here you can find two of the most basic topics you will see in a linear algebra course, least squares and ortogonalization.


## Least Squares

The least squares file gives you the possibility to construct a real $n$ degree polynomial to approximate a set of point that are specified by you. Please consider that this only uses real variable polynomials, not other classes of functions. At the end of the execution you can find the coefficients of your polynomial that are presented in the form of an $R^n$ vector

## Ortogonalization

Once you get to see orthogonal sets, projections, vector spaces, you need to construct a set of orthogonal vectors. Fortunately there is an algorithm called [Gram-Schmidt Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram%E2%80%93Schmidt_process) where you can build a set of orthogonal vectors given a vector and a vector space. Nevertheless it can get boring if the dimension is too high and you have many vectors that are not orthogonal between them, so I coded this algorithm that just uses Gram-Schmidt Process so I can save time from my lectures just doing pointless operations
